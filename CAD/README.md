# X7Segment Display
X7 Segment displays are RGB LED based 7 Segment boards that you can chain together and control via any micro-controller just like you would control a strip of RGB LEDs. They just require VCC, GND and Data from a GPIO.

You can purchase these displays pre-built on [tindie](https://www.tindie.com/products/16900/)

I have released this project as open source, so if you would like you make your own for personal use, you can download the CAD files from this repo.
