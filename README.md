# X7Segment Display
X7 Segment displays are RGB LED based 7 Segment boards that you can chain together and control via any micro-controller just like you would control a strip of RGB LEDs. They just require VCC, GND and Data from a GPIO.

You can purchase these displays pre-built on [tindie](https://www.tindie.com/products/16900/)

I have released this project as open source, so if you would like you make your own for personal use, you can download the CAD files from this repo.

The hardware has been released as open source under the CERN license. Please review the license before using these files in your own projects to understand your obligations.

The software has been released as open source under the MIT license. Please review the license before using these files in your own projects to understand your obligations.

# X7Segment Display Library
An API that lets you display numbers and letters on X7Segment RGB LED displays that are available from [tindie](https://www.tindie.com/products/16900/)

You can find the Open Source hardware PCB design and Gerber files [here](https://github.com/UnexpectedMaker/X7Segment/CAD)

I love designing, making and releasing our projects as open source. I do it because I believe itâ€™s important to share knowledge and give back to the community, like many have done before me. It helps us all learn and grow.

That said, a lot of time, effort and finances have gone into designing and releasing these files, so please consider supporting me by buy some of my TiinyPICO products:
